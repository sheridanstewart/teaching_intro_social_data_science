    "# Notebook 2: Manipulating, Quantifying, and Visualizating Text Data\n",

    "#### A quick note about this notebook versus subsequent notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, this class is meant to be a bit like a series of workshops, many of which could be self-contained. If you feel a bit lost amid all the code, that's okay—and if this all strikes you as incredibly basic, that's okay, too! Subsequent notebooks will use various methods to analyze a corpus in a way that can produce sociologically-interesting knowledge. These notebooks will be accessible even if you don't feel confident in your ability to follow the code because the focus won't be on the coding. The notebooks should also be interesting even if the code seems pretty basic to you because we'll be looking at applications to social research.\n",

    "#### A quick note about this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll begin to look at how to use libraries like `pandas` to manage and manipulate text. We'll also build toward different ways of quantifying information about documents and visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only the second notebook, and this is all preliminary material. From here, we'll move on to measures like TF-IDF that can be used for information retrieval (e.g., search engines) and measuring document similarity, which has all sorts of applications in the social sciences. TF-IDF is also a jumping off point for other measures we'll consider, including dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have an initial go at using `pandas` with a dataset of tweets from January 6, 2021. You can download the dataset from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/capitol-riot-tweets). Just unzip/extract the archive and place the CSV in the same directory as this notebook (or edit the `f = \"...\"` line in the following cell to include the file path).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to import the `pandas` library using an *alias*, `pd`."

The following line means that we will drop any rows with missing data for the \"text\" column, and we will keep all other rows–even if they are missing data for other columns. We lose only one row this way."

    "Now let's apply the `.join()` method to a list of integers just to see what it does. The first line below uses a list comprehension that iterates through the values 0-9 (`for i in range(10)`) like a simple for loop. For each valaue, it casts the value as a string using the `str()` function. In the second line, we print the result as well as the type to see that it's a list. In the next line of code, we use the `.join()` method using a single space to join the items in the list. The last line prints the result, followed by the type, showing us the result is now just a string. Importantly, we can't use `.join()` if the list doesn't contain only strings. It was necessary to apply `str()` to each value in the first line. We will sometimes use this approach during preprocessing data, where we will `.split()` a document into a list of tokens (namely, mostly words), do various things to those words, and then put the whole document back together with `.join()`."

how it is that 6 days after announcing she was positive for covid with symptoms she was somehow able to travel to wisconsin to dc to enter the capitol and deliver pelosi a needed vote for speaker enough is enough if youre still a supporter youre a fucking traitor the national guard and state troopers should arrest everyone at the capitol then arrest trump you telling me black amp brown people protest peacefully and are violently attacked with rubber bullets tear gas etc but trump supporters can aggressively break in the capitol and the police dont use the same excessive violence and force these will be the last people allowed into the capitol building there will be walls built and armed guards just like terrorists change air travel forever they have now changed how people will be able to visit our capital i see a lot of privilege right now at the capitol i wonder what the environment would look like if these people acting this way looked different i am simply sadden amp disgusted a

hey fuckwad you going to travel to dc and lend them a hand in prosecuting all those asshats who are storming the capitol building or do you only offer your services to pursuits that you feel will help you personally my small travel hairspray in my purse was confiscated last time entering the capitol this is insane and will travel to capitol hill to resolve issues meanwhile will tweet from milan a

question obliviously these maga trump supporters attacking the capitol in dc do not have jobsso who is paying their travel food amp hotel expenses capitolbuilding im hoping any us citizens and canadian citizens that may be near the us capitol to please stay safe and do not travel out it is chaotic here right now this is what domestic terrorism looks like this is donald trumps america imagine the police response if these were black people breaking into the capitol if you dont see white supremacy and a total threat to democracy when you see this its because you dont want to i couldnt imagine being so enamored with someone that i would drop everything miss work and travel all the way to dc and go storm the capitol on a wednesday reminder fo what capitol security in full militarygrade riot gear looked like for black lives matter protests this summer the proud boys travel state lines and to places they arent from to intimidate the proud boys were the ones storming the

travel one note about the us capitol building there are a network of underground tunnels that lawmakers and staff could ostensibly use to travel to other somewhat removed housesenate buildings if necessary are the people storming the capitol who mcconnell was worried about benefiting from a 2k relief because theyve got ther and and the time to travel to dc and participate in a coup attempt therefore i agree mitch they dont need the relief  senators being evacuated as protesters storm the capitol trump supporters seen here discharging a fire extinguisher and officers are literally standing there and watching them where are the police where are the national guard african missions in us are watching keenly chaotic scenes at us capitol hill where the us congress is meetingwe are deeply concerned about safety of all africans have thereby asked africans not to embark on any non essential travel to the us if what is happening now at capitol hill was happening in africa usa media houses wouldve declared that country a failed state bbc and if that country was kenya the wouldve issued a travel advisory against kenya how about that one note about the us capitol building there are a network of underground tunnels that lawmakers and staff could ostensibly use to travel to other somewhat removed housesenate buildings if necessary if what is happening now at capitol hill was happening in africa usa media houses wouldve declared that country a failed state bbc and if that country was kenya the wouldve issued a travel advisory against kenya how about that capitol police just tear gassed the rotunda and asked members of congress to don the gas masks under their seats on the floor of the senate are we still uncomfortable calling this a coup if what is happening now at capitol hill was happening in africa usa media houses wouldve decalred that country a failed state bbc and if that country was kenya the wouldve issued a travel advisory against kenya how about that capitol hill police are also blocking anyone from moving from senate office buildings into the us capitol building there are underground tunnels that link the office buildings with the capitol building that senators staff and journalists use to travel back and forth with all this violence going on im surprised that countries like kenya havent put out travel advisories this is the ghetto capitol police should never have a reason to act up again we wont forget how they reacted i dont think i should travel to dc tonightthe capitol isnt that far from union station african missions in us are watching keenly chaotic scenes at us capitol hill where the us congress is meetingwe are deeply concerned about safety of all africans have thereby asked africans not to embark on any non essential travel to the us call your nazi thugs out of the capitol trump supporters are literally breaking into the us capitol and im talking about the phone all to ga sos where he threatened him to find ballots and how about the first xo he did the muslim travel ban you clearly know nothing about politics nor law and you look idiotic watching these people waltz around inside the capitol reminds me of the 4 backup officers called in for additional screening because id forgotten about the tiny keychain of travel pepper stay in my backpack capitol hill police are also blocking anyone from moving from senate office buildings into the us capitol building there are underground tunnels that link the office buildings with the capitol building that senators staff and journalists use to travel back and forth imagine being so butthurt your political candidate lost an election that you felt the need to take time off work to travel to the capitol of the us and terrorize lawmakers just so everyone is aware congress is in lockdown right now due to trump supporters most of whom do not live in dc and did not follow travel mandates storming the us capitol building because they refuse to accept that he lost thinking about this a lot storming a capitol to forcibly change the outcome of a democratic election is treasonous if this were happening in a developing country the state department would issue a travel warning and the headline would say democracy crumbles cops shot a bunch of moms with rubber bullets but arent stopping the white supremacists storming the capitol in case you still dont understand why people distrust the police this is history the president of the united states demanded a violent mob storm the capitol to defy the constitution and overturn the decision of the american people imagine being this mad about the election that you travel to the capitol breach the building and thenwhat a registry of muslims an actual border wall and travel bans

We'll ultimately set `reverse` to `True` so that the most frequent types are put first, and we'll use a lambda function to sort the results using the *second* value (indexed by `[1]`, since Python starts at 0). When we cast the Counter's `.items()` as a list, we have a list of `tuples`. In this case, the tuples are the unique types and the freqeuncy of that type (e.g., `('the', 5153)`). We want to sort on the second value of each tuple (the frequency) to put the most frequent types first."

Put one way, there is a negative correlation between the rank of a word (where 1 = most frequent) and its frequency.\n",

These tools and skills will also transfer to other areas, so don't worry if studying culture isn't 100% your bag!"
